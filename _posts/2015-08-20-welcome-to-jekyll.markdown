In an effort to find a new job in the web development world, I've spent the last few months training myself on all sorts of topics through the web. I can say that in 3 months on the internet I learned more than I ever did in 4+ years of college. My internet bill is also much cheaper than my tuition was.

The goal of this site started out as a way to learn Jekyll, a language that I kept seeing pop up on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev">web development forums</a>. I quickly figured out that I could make a Jekyll website to host a digital portfolio for potential employers and also blog about the coding projects I'm working on. Jekyll is very clean and lightweight, and has great load times, which is perfect for what I'm doing. Check back for my portfolio and some projects I'm working on, just as soon as I can figure out how to add another page.

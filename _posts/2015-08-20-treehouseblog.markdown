One of the best resources that I have found over the last few months in my "refresher to web development" journey has been <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Team Treehouse</a>. I left my previous job where I was doing site management and web development using what somebody else had already built. Even thought I have been building websites since the early 2000's, I felt pretty overwhelmed coming back out into the world of web development after doing it "their way" for the past couple of years. 

After watching countless YouTube tutorials and reading a ton of blogs, I stumbled upon Team Treehouse and their awesome web development courses. I signed up for the 30-day free trial and have been paying for their $25/mo subscription service ever since. I have been spending more time than I'd like to admit working through their coursework and at this point I'm probably annoying my friends by talking about it.

Team Treehouse has a great learning structure. They offer a huge variety of "Tracks", such as Front-End Web Development, Web Design, Rails Development, and the list goes on. Once you choose your track everything is organized just like a college class. You watch some lectures, take some quizes, and do some challenges along the way. The cool thing about their courses is that you are always working on a real life example. These classes teach you exactly how to do something, explain why you're doing it, and then apply it to a project that you could use in a portfolio. 

The community on Team Treehouse is very active and any questions I had about a lesson have already been asked and answered, and if not, one of the teachers was there within minutes to respond. The fact that these "professors" were mid-20s to early-30s was also really cool, not just some old grouch with out-dated methods like many of the ones I had in college.

I cannot give them enough credit. To reiterate what I said in my first blog post, I learned more from <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Team Treehouse</a> in just a couple weeks than I learned in an entire semester of "Web Development 1" in college. I could go on about this website for days but I think it's 5 o'clock somewhere.
